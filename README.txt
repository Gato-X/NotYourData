About the Game
----------------

You're a jumping ball and you've got a (data)base to protect.

But're not that defenseless...  you shoot homing missiles.

There are data blocks scattered throughout the map which you need
to collect, just follow the beacons. But don't get too distracted!
The Leechers will try to rob your data, and you need to stop them.

When you collect 100% of the data blocks you complete the level.

However, if they manage to steal 50% of the data you've collected,
you lose.



Running the Game
----------------

You'll need Python 2.7, and the following libraries:

 - pygame
 - NumPy
 - PIL or Pillow
 - PyOpenGL

(It doesn't require any external engine)


I tested the game on Linux and Windows.

Now, in theory:

On Windows or Mac OS X, locate the "run_game.pyw" file and double-click it.

Othewise open a terminal / console and "cd" to the game directory and run:

  python run_game.py



How to Play the Game
--------------------

Use the arrow keys (or WASD) to move around

Jump with space

Shoot with enter

Have fun!
